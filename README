wp2print - Convert WordPress Blog to print ready PDF
===============================================================================

ABOUT 

This project contains code to export posts from WordPress and convert them into
DocBook XML. The resulting DocBook is then converted to XSL-FO which can be
used for conversion into PDF.


Example usage (see Makefile for complete example):

  $ php wp2docbook.php -b -o quasi-docbook.xml
  $ xsltproc \
	--stringparam media.file.path '/var/www/blog' \
	--stringparam blog.url 'http://localhost/blog/' \
	wp-html2docbook.xsl quasi-docbook.xml > docbook-final.xml
  $ xsltproc /path/to/docbook-xsl/fo/docbook.xsl docbook-final.xml > book.fo
  $ fop book.fo book.pdf

SIMPLE EXAMPLE BLOG

For demonstration purposes only, I've included an export of a simple blog
consisting of posts of Shakespeare's sonnets. To run the example:

1. Install a fresh copy of WordPress
2. Install the wordpress-importer plugin
3. Import the contents from sample/shakespeare-blog-wordpress-export.xml
4. Edit the lib/config.php file with the appropriate settings
5. Edit the conf/userconf.xconf file to the full path of truetype fonts
6. Edit the Makefile and set the URL and full path to the WordPress install
7. $ make
8. View book.pdf

The steps outlined above are only guidelines and some extra finagling may be in
order.
